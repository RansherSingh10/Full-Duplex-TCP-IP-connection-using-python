# Full-Duplex-TCP-IP-connection-using-python
Server code and Client code are given seperately.
This is a full duplex connection as both client and server can send data simultaneously. This is achieved by making different functions for both sending data and receiving data on both the client side and the server side and running both the functions simultaneously using threading.
